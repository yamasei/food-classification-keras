# food-classification-tensorflow
This project is one of the examples of image classification using deep learning.

Tne image data set I used is food-101, and I chose 5 kinds of food from this dataset.

If you want to use CNN, please run "train_food_CNN.py".

And if you want to use RNN, please run "train_food_RNN.py".
